Unfortunately, investment was cut off and project decided to be discontinued, so we moved the project to the open source arena. \r\n\r\nWe will continue to support it if any issue arises and we will work on a roadmap to build further features and integration with other social channels in the next period. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Setup & Installation\r\n\r\nFirst step is to create a postresql database and create a virtual environment with :\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> virtualenv djsocial_env\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond step is to clone the project and install the requirements\r\n\r\n    1) git clone git@github.com:mo-mughrabi/djsocial.git\r\n    2) pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    3) cp settings/development.py settings/local_env.py\r\n    3) python manage.py resetdb\r\n\r\nThe last commands loads fixture data for groups and the admin user.\r\n\r\nTo change the admin password use the following command in the django shell:\r\n\r\n```    \r\n>>> admin = User.objects.get(id=1)\r\n>>> admin.setpassword(\"new_password\")\r\n>>> admin.save()\r\n```\r\n \r\nNote that you need to edit the file settings/local_env.py with:\r\n\r\n    * Database credentials\r\n    * Twitter app cosumer key and secret\r\n    * Amazon access Key and Secret\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* Mo Mughrabi - Lead developer\r\n* Ahmed Elhamidi - Developer\r\n* Mariusz Kosakowski - Developer\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
