{"name":"DjSocial","tagline":"django social","body":"Introduction\r\n-----\r\n\r\ndjsocial was developed as initiative to create a robotic web based solution for social media, starting with twitter\r\nand expanding later to other channels. Unfortunately, investment was cut off and project decided to be discontinued,\r\nso we moved the project to the open source arena.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to support it if any issue arises and we will work on a roadmap to build further features and\r\nintegration with other social channels in the next period.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, djsocial is built with twitter integration. With the following functionality\r\n\r\n    1) Auto follow certain hashtags\r\n    2) Auto favorite certain hashtags\r\n    3) Auto follow back\r\n    4) Auto unfollow backard\r\n\r\n\r\nSetup and Installation\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe solution will only work on *postgresql* databases, since we are heavily using hstore dictionary fields in our\r\nmodel design.\r\n\r\nto begin clone the project and install the requirements\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:mo-mughrabi/djsocial.git\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    cp settings/development.py settings/local_env.py\r\n    python manage.py resetdb\r\n\r\nThe last commands loads fixture data for groups and the admin user.\r\n\r\nTo change the admin password use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> python manage.py changepassword admin\r\n```\r\n    \r\nNote that you need to edit the file  settings/local_env.py with :\r\n\r\n    * Database credentials\r\n    * Twitter app cosumer key and secret\r\n\r\n\r\nTo execute scheduled tasks, celery needs to be running (rabbitmq required):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> python manage.py celery worker -Q djsocial -B -E --loglevel=INFO\r\n```\r\n\r\n    \r\nContributors\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    * Mo Mughrabi - Lead developer\r\n    * Ahmed Elhamidi - Developer\r\n    * Mariusz Kosakowski - Developer\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
